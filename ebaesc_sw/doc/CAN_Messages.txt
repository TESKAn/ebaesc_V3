# Raw ESC command normalized into [-8192, 8191]; negative values indicate reverse rotation.
# The ESC should normalize the setpoint into its effective input range.
# Non-zero setpoint value below minimum should be interpreted as min valid setpoint for the given motor.

#
# Simple RPM setpoint.
# The ESC should automatically clamp the setpoint according to the minimum and maximum supported RPM;
# for example, given a ESC that operates in the range 100 to 10000 RPM, a setpoint of 1 RPM will be clamped to 100 RPM.
# Negative values indicate reverse rotation.
